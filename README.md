# Titanic Classification Model


Hi LinkedIn People,




This is My Project Which I Have Completed In Correspondence To **CodeAlpha** , As a Data-Science Internship Project.



This is a Simple Project Known as **Titanic Classification Project**. This is a Very Popular Problem Based Project as It Has Appeared In Kaggle Competitions From Where I've Used The Dataset Of This Problem. This Dataset Contains Factors And The Details On Each Passenger On Whether They Survived The Sinking Of The Titanic Ship And Contains The Data Of 800+ Passengers Of The Ship.



**Problem Statement:**



As This Problem Tends To Narrow Down The Most Common Factors (Passenger Class, Age, Gender, Shore From Which The Passenger Embarked) On Whose Basis The Passengers Survived.





**Libraries Used:**



Some Of The Common Data Science Libraries Used To Solve This Problem Are As Follows:



- Numpy, Pandas (For Mathematical Processing) 

- Test Train Split (For Classifying Data For Training & Testing The Model

- Matplotlib (For Graphical Representation Of Data)

- Logistic Regression (For Predicting The Probability Of Passengers Survived Based On The Factors)

- Sklearn Metrics (For Interpreting The Model's Performance In Terms Of Accuracy, Precision etc)

- Label Encoder & Standard Scalar (For Encoding Input Values In Lower Dimensions)
